# GreatMinds Hub

**Problem Statement:**  
How might we reduce friction in activity sign-ups for both individuals and caregivers, while minimizing manual effort for staff in managing and consolidating registration data?

**Overview:**  
GreatMinds Hub is a unified platform that allows seniors, volunteers, and admins to manage activity participation seamlessly. Admins can create and manage activities, volunteers can offer their helping hands, and seniors or caretakers can register for activities while considering membership types and scheduling conflicts.
